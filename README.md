- 👋 Hi, I’m @trailinglight; obviously not a real name, it sparks as a representation of feelings about my goals and dreams and the ultimate path towards realizing ideas that sometimes feel just as fleeting and vibrant.
- 👀 I’m interested in many different aspects of the creative universe, mainly centered around stroytelling whether that be through writing, games, music and / or art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and relearning my way around source control, game engines, code and structures. Writing is a continuous thing for me, that needs no exposition, as something that I enjoy and recreate myself in on a seemingly neverending basis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pet projects and long term plans for storytelling or game devleopment.
- 📫 There are multiple ways to contact me, including email (lighttrails@protonmail.com) and on discord (trailinglight#1873). BEWARE, as much as of an introverted homebody as I am, my messages can be unwieldy and verbose. I appreciate constructive feedback and enjoy brainstorming ideas.
